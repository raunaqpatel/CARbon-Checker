# CARbon-Checker
Website to check Carbon footprint of your car and how well it performs with world average and world target

<strong>Concept:</strong>
As per EU commission, we need to reduce Car CO2 emissions to the average of 95mg/km.
This data visualisation allows you to check where your car stands in terms of World Average CO2 emissions and Target of 2021.

<strong>Goal:</strong>
To make people a bit more aware about the environmental impact of the car they are purchasing. In the future, maybe the user can compare the car he is buying with other cars in a similar price range but more environmentally friendly.
